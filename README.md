# Studying git

In this repository I show some Git commands that I learned when I was studying.

> Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:

- git init - creates a new Git repository
- git status - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
- git add - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
- git diff - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
- git commit - permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
- git log - shows a list of all previous commits
